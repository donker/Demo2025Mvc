# DNN MVC 2 module solution

This is a test solution that generates 2 MVC modules (Demo1 and Demo2) that can be stuck on a DNN page.
You can use it to see what happens when you click on details on one module vs another.

The intention of the project is to be a test module for the [new DNN MVC pipeline](https://github.com/DNN-Connect/Dnn.Platform/tree/MVCPL) some of use
are working on.
